* **Available**: Our artifact is "Available" as it is publicly accessible through the following repository.
  * Github: [<https://github.com/kupl/SmartFix-Artifact>](https://github.com/kupl/SmartFix-Artifact/releases/tag/fse2023)

* **Reusable**: Our artifact is "Reusable" (and also "Functional") as we meet the following five criteria (the first four are the criteria for "Functional" badge) mentioned in the [artifact submission guideline](https://2023.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2023-artifacts).
  * _Documented_: We provide the following documents necessary for using our artifact: (1) README, (2) REQUIREMENTS, (3) STATUS, (4) LICENSE, (5) INSTALL, and (6) a copy of the accepted paper.
  * _Consistent & Complete_: We provide concrete steps for reproducing the main experimental results in the paper.
  * _Exercisable_: We provide scripts and related commands for running experiments.
  * _Reusable for Future Researches_: We provide concrete instructions for running SmartFix on other new Solidity contracts. Thus, other researchers can use SmartFix in their own research.
