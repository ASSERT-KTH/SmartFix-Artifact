## Operating System
We recommend using **Ubuntu 20.04** or **Ubuntu 22.04**. 

## Hardware
We recommend machines equipped with at least 64 cores and 64GB RAM to stably reproduce the experimental results in our paper.

## Software
* We assume [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) is installed in your hardware. All experimental results will be reproduced in a dockerized environment.
* To run docker commands without ``sudo``, run the following commands (source: https://askubuntu.com/a/739861):
  ```
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  ```
